Laksmi is building an interactive task list application in order to keep track of her tasks. She wants to be able to use a form to capture the task name, due date and category (i.e. school, personal or work) and save this information to a table called tasks. She would also like a page where she can view all her tasks. 

Laksmi has started to develop the application but is missing some key pieces. In order to complete this lab, you will need to complete/provide the missing code and test to see whether the application is functioning as required. 

The files you have included are: addtask.php (to add a task to the db), index.php (contains a form to allow the user to add a new task), connect.php (contains db connection info), viewtasks.php (to show all tasks and task information) and query.sql (contains the SQL statements need to build the tasks table). 

Once you have your application functioning, you can launch it on the production server (AWS webserver).
